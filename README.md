# 🎓 CS Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal hub for everything related to my computer science journey. This repo is a living document of my path into tech — from self-taught fundamentals to hands-on projects, and eventually to formal CS studies starting in the fall of 2025.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository acts as a central map of content (MOC) for all my learning and practice projects. It documents what I’ve built so far, what I’m currently learning, and where I’m heading.

**Status:** Pre-CS student preparing for a part-time degree  
**Main Language:** Python (for now — expanding as I go)  
**Focus:** Practical skills, project-based learning, and consistent progress

## 🚀 Learning Projects

Most of these began as course assignments, but I only share projects that I’ve **significantly built on, expanded, or customized**.

## 🚀 Real-World Projects

These are the first projects I’ve built with Python to solve real problems — at least for me. They’re small but meaningful steps that address actual needs and keep me excited to keep learning.
