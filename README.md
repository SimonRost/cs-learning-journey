# 🎓 CS Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal hub for all things related to my computer science journey. This repo is a living document of my path into tech — from self-taught fundamentals to hands-on projects, and eventually through formal CS studies starting Fall 2025.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository acts as a central map of content (MOC) for all my learning and practice projects. It documents what I’ve built so far, what I’m currently learning, and where I’m heading.

**Status:** Pre-CS student preparing for a part-time degree  
**Main Language:** Python (for now — expanding as I go)  
**Focus:** Practical skills, project-based learning, and consistent progress

## ✍️ My Philosophy

> “Progress over perfection.”  
> I learn by doing — building things, breaking things, writing about the process, and sharing the journey. My goal is not to be flawless but to be consistent and curious.
