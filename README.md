# CS Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal hub for everything related to my computer science journey. This repo is a living document of my path into tech ‚Äî from self-taught fundamentals to hands-on projects, and eventually to formal CS studies starting in the fall of 2025.

## Learning Projects

Most of these began as course assignments, but I only share projects that I‚Äôve **significantly built on, expanded, or customized**.

## Real-World Projects

These are the first projects I‚Äôve built with Python to solve real problems ‚Äî at least for me. They‚Äôre small but meaningful steps that address actual needs and keep me excited to keep learning.
